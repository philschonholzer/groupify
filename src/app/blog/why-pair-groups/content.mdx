## The birth of Groupli

Groupli is not just an app, it's a solution to my problem. In our team, we all give each other feedback every week. Since we don't want to pair up with someone we just paired up with last time, we needed to keep track of who gave each other feedback. This turned out to be quite a problem. Every week someone might be missing, or a pair might not be able to finish their feedback.  To solve this problem, I created Groupli - an easy-to-use app that ensures that group members are paired freshly every round.

## How does Groupli work?

Groupli's functionality is simple, yet powerful. Here are its key features:

1. **User-friendly interface:** You can create a group and add members without logging in. All you have to do is enter the name of each member. That's it!

2. **Automatic group pairing:** Every round, Groupli knows which people have been paired recently. So it can create pairs that have not been made in a long time.

3. **Skip and shuffle:** If a member is absent or a pair can't finish their task, you can skip them. If the suggested pairs don't work for you, you can shuffle them.

4. **Remember the URL:** You can access your group using your unique URL. Just bookmark it and you can access your group anytime.

## Why use Groupli?

- Build Team Spirit:** By meeting new group members regularly, team bonding and collaboration are strengthened.
- Expand Your Network:** In larger organizations or social circles, members who may never have met can make new connections.
- Dynamic Feedback Environments:** In study groups or professional settings, Groupli ensures that feedback is given in a fresh and varied way.
