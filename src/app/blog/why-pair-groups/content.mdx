## The Birth of Groupli

Groupli is not just an app, it's a solution to my problem. In our team, we all give feedback to each other every week. Since we don't want to pair up with someone we just paired up with last time, we had to keep track of who gave each other feedback. This turned out to be quite a problem. Every week, someone might be missing, or a pair might not be able to finish their feedback.  To solve this problem, I created Groupli - an easy-to-use app that ensures that group members are paired in a fresh and engaging way every round.

## How Does Groupli Work?

Groupli's functionality is simple yet effective. Here are its key features:

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** Without signing up, you can create a group and add members. You just need to enter the name of each member. That's it!

2. **Automated Group Pairing:** Each round, Groupli knows which people were paired lately. So it can create pairs that did not occur for a long time.

3. **Skip and Shuffle:** If a member is absent or a pair can't finish its task, you can skip them. If the suggested pairs don't work for you, you can shuffle them.

4. **Just remember the URL:** You can access your group with your unique URL. Just bookmark it, and you can access your group anytime.

## Why Use Groupli?

- **Enhance Team Spirit:** By regularly getting to know new group members, the bond and collaboration within the team are strengthened.
- **Expand Your Network:** In larger organizations or social circles, members who might never have met can form new connections.
- **Dynamic Feedback Environments:** In study groups or professional settings, Groupli ensures that feedback is given in a fresh and varied way.
